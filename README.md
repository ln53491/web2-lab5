# Audio Recorder Progressive Web-app
### Advanced Web Development

This is a demonstration of PWA which uses **Web Audio API** and **MediaRecorder** for capturing device's microphone's audio and saving it as a .webm audio file. Upon saving and uploading audio file's size to a dummy post API, a push notification is sent to notify the user that the upload has been successful.
Made using **ReactJS**.
